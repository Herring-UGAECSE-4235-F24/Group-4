// We will enable the driver to drive a low and disable it to drive a high

// Function to define and setup the Two GPIOs that will be used or SDA and SCL

// Function to write with address and data

// Function to Read address with returned data

// User should be prompted to either be able to a) read the value of the rtc, b) write time to the RTC

// We will most likely have to pull the GPIO high by setting the GPIO to an input and set it low by making it an output
